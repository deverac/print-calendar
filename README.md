`print-calendar` makes it easy to print a blank, monthly calendar. Simple modifications, such as hiding or enlarging the month name, can be performed prior to printing.

All functionality is contained in a single HTML file.

Try `print-calendar` [online](https://deverac.github.io/print-calendar/).

A [simpler version](https://deverac.github.io/print-calendar/cal.html) allows no customization other than selecting the month and year. Clicking on `Today:` will return the calendar to the current month.
